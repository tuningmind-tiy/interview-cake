          <p>Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as a list, where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The indices are the time in minutes past 
              trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
            </li>
            <li>
              The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock 
              at that time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, 
            stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500.
          </p>
          <p>
            Write an efficient function that takes 
            stock_prices_yesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9] and 
            returns the best profit I could have made from 1 
            purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.
